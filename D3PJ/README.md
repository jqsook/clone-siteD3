--Icons in all sections-
Icons were just generic ones pulled at the time- didnt invest the time to pull actual Mac/Apple, Android, facebook/twitter.

---Images--
Find non-copywright generic images

--Video--
Add a youtube link embedded video- use the code from todays lecture on github.
Need to find how to add an aspect ratio.-chrome developer tool?

---Font---
I looked up what it would take to change the font and that requires CSS- bootstrap has a default font that will need to be overridden. SO that caused the page to crash. .font was not tagged to any item, but the whole page changed font and the color in the background went away.

-----Css----
I imagine the goal of this challenge was to learn the box model and how to use the "container, row, column" system more than prettying it up.

----Box hover-----
Hover-shadow
